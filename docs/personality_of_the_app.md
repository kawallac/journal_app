1. Overall Personality of the App

Think of the app as a “character.”
What vibes should it give off?

I want the feel to be minimilist, modern, and timeless

What emotions should it evoke when you open it?

The emotions should be a feeling of relaxation because you know you have everything in one place and organized. The feeling of no stress as interaction with the app is intutive and easy to follow. 

2. Color Preferences

You’ve expressed liking clean, minimalist design.

Basic white with subtle color accents. Not sure of the color. I like orange (hence my domain poweroforange.net) but that can be overpowering. So maybe earthtone? I will let you have free range of what you think is best. This is a living document so we can adjust



3. Typography

How do you want text to feel?

I want the text inviting, easy to read, and match modern yet timeless.


4. Journal Page Look


right now lets keep the subtle card with a shadow. 

5. Interaction Philosophy

How should it feel to interact with things?

I like tactile and slightly playful (draggable tags, smooth animations)


On a spectrum of:

Zen calm ←——→ Energetic + animated
Where do you want the app to sit? 
I sit with zen calm

6. Tags UX Feel

Tags are a huge part of this app.

Do you want them to feel:

I like the current style, is there a way to make more subtle?

Should dragging a tag feel:

It Should feel smooth and slightly animated


7. Navigation Philosophy

As the app grows, you'll have:

journal view

search view

notebooks (spaces)

settings

timeline/history (future?)

tasks (future?)

mobile layout

Do you prefer:

sidebar navigation (current direction)? I would propose back what other options are there? Again this is a living document we can amend as we go. 

minimal layout with hidden menus? We will get there

keyboard shortcuts? Not at the moment

Is the sidebar allowed to grow later?

8. Mobile UX (Future)

What matters most on mobile? Ease of navigation, ease of readability

quick capture? This will be a future feature

reading old entries? yes

tag browsing? if we can make it work. I don't want clutter

searching? yes

Should the mobile feel:

like a lightweight companion? I am thinking a lightweight companion

9. Interaction Speed

Your journal app is meant to be fast for thinking.

Do you prefer:

explicit Save button only? Leave this for now. 


Should navigation feel:

instantaneous (snappy transitions)

or more flowing (smooth animated transitions)? Lets start with flowing

10. Any apps you love the UX of?

Not to copy them — but to understand your taste.

I am imagining a notes section like Google Keep, where notes are tiled for viewing.
